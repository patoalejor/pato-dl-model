# DL models compilation

Here is a compilation of reusable block-code for training DL models. This repo will mainly use the library pytorch and lighting for building the networks.

## Tasks

This repo configure three different tasks for DL

- Classification
- Regression
- Autoencoders

## Neural Netorks

These are the basic architectures implemented

- MLP
- CNN
- LSTM
